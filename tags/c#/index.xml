This was built during a time where I would do the Worldle on the daily. The most rewarding part was extracting all the different countries&amp;rsquo; svg images - this part was done using the C# HttpClient. Give it a try - a new country appears everytime you load the page ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p&gt;

Our team was composed entirely of strangers, three of whom were programmers and one artist. Because of this imbalance, I ended up taking more of a QA and Project Management role in the team, but it was still a fun time.
I still remember staying late with one of the other team members and building the title screen and opening sequence from scratch. I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of the transition that happens when you hit the start button. I also named the game!&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this project was to implement an algorithm that procedurally generates a new maze on every game.
The specific algorithm used for Maze Roller consisted of using quad-edges, a graph and its dual graph to build the maze, and depth-first search to traverse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Click onto the game to take control. Use WASD keys to rotate the board and move the ball to the goal!
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Press the 'r' key to reload the level and see the maze take on different forms.
&lt;/h4&gt;

You can access it at &lt;a class="link" href="https://tenkiame.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;tenkiame.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to build this because of a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather apps feel like a good kind of app to tick off when it comes to building personal projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also wanted an excuse to build a web app in C# - a language I&amp;rsquo;m fond of from my Unity days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest learnings came from setting up the web server and deploying the app, more so than calling the APIs which I originally thought was going to be the most valuable piece of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
