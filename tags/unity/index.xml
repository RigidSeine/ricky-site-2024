Our team was composed entirely of strangers, three of whom were programmers and one artist. Because of this imbalance, I ended up taking more of a QA and Project Management role in the team, but it was still a fun time.
I still remember staying late with one of the other team members and building the title screen and opening sequence from scratch. I&amp;rsquo;m very proud of the transition that happens when you hit the start button. I also named the game!&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this project was to implement an algorithm that procedurally generates a new maze on every game.
The specific algorithm used for Maze Roller consisted of using quad-edges, a graph and its dual graph to build the maze, and depth-first search to traverse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Click onto the game to take control. Use WASD keys to rotate the board and move the ball to the goal!
&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Press the 'r' key to reload the level and see the maze take on different forms.
&lt;/h4&gt;
