It&amp;rsquo;s not quite as fancy as ChatGPT, but it&amp;rsquo;s still an AI model that uses deep learning aka a neural network.
Makemore is the name of the model - it&amp;rsquo;s a model that&amp;rsquo;s trained on American names and the idea is that it can generalise and create &amp;ldquo;name-like&amp;rdquo; words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to be educated on AI to understand that while it&amp;rsquo;s useful, its capabilities and use cases in the public space thus far have not warranted the evangelism it&amp;rsquo;s gotten, and in some ways it exacerbates the very problems that AI was meant to solve (e.g. getting rid of spam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, link below has the process of me putting together Makemore - it&amp;rsquo;s not intended to be a guide so it&amp;rsquo;s not the nicest read I&amp;rsquo;ve written. The repo also has Jupyter notebooks that can be run to use it, but in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll look to make something more user-friendly and doesn&amp;rsquo;t require additional setup. I hope to create more AI models in the future, but my current focus is upskilling in software development.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
