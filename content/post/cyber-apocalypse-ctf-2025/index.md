This one comes a little late since it's been two months after it ended, but I swear it's because I was working another project.

Regardless, this event was a little special because my friend [**Nathan**](https://nathan-ellison.com/) gathered up a bunch of folks from the NZ Hack the Box Discord channel and filled up the team. Because of that, our team did astonishingly well - a whopping 294th out of 8130 teams. It turns out two (or many, in this case) heads are in fact better than one.

My focus this time around was on a web challenge which involved exploiting an SSTI exploit. No, not a super sexually transmitted infection exploit, a Server-Side Template Injection exploit. I've put together a [writeup]( {{< relref "cyber-apocalypse-ctf-2025-writeup/index.md" >}}) as well (it's got a boss battle against a dragon!).
