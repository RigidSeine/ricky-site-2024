In May 2024, our team of software developers and cybersecurity professionals from the Department of Corrections and NZ Police joined 943 others in the HackTheBox Business Capture The Flag(CTF) competition. Over half a week, we solved 20 challenging cybersecurity puzzles, each puzzle featuring a scenario themed around the Fallout video game series!

This competition was all about creative problem-solving and collaboration. Solving these challenges tested our problem-solving skills and taught us a few new tricks like XML entity inclusion, and mounting the file system in Windows Subsystem for Linux to find the system flag.

Participating in this event was a fun experience. We're proud of our achievements and can't wait for next year.
Below is my certificate for competing.
