This project was a step in my journey to learn more about Artificial Intelligence (AI). It's not quite as fancy as ChatGPT, but it's still an AI model that uses deep learning aka a neural network.
Makemore is the name of the model - it's a model that's trained on American names and the idea is that it can generalise and create "name-like" words. 

It's good to be educated on AI to understand that while it's useful, its capabilities and use cases in the public space thus far have not warranted the evangelism it's gotten, and in some ways it exacerbates the very problems that AI was meant to solve (e.g. getting rid of spam).

Anyways, link below has the process of me putting together Makemore - it's not intended to be a guide so it's not the nicest read I've written. The repo also has Jupyter notebooks that can be run to use it, but in the future I'll look to make something more user-friendly and doesn't require additional setup. I hope to create more AI models in the future, but my current focus is upskilling in software development.
