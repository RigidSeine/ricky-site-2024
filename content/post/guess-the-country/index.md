The goal of Guess the Country is, funnily enough, in the name. This was built during a time where I would do the Worldle on the daily. The most rewarding part was extracting all the different countries' svg images - this part was done using the C# HttpClient. Give it a try - a new country appears everytime you load the page ðŸ˜Š
