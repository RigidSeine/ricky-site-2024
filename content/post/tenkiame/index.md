TenkiAme (pronounced ten-key-ah-meh) is a weather forecasting application that integrates with various APIs to provide weather and UV index information. You can access it at [tenkiame.org](https://tenkiame.org).

I wanted to build this because of a couple of reasons:
- Weather apps feel like a good kind of app to tick off when it comes to building personal projects.
- I also wanted an excuse to build a web app in C# - a language I'm fond of from my Unity days.

The biggest learnings came from setting up the web server and deploying the app, more so than calling the APIs which I originally thought was going to be the most valuable piece of knowledge.
