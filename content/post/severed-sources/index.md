This game was built in a weekend not long before the COVID lockdown happened. Our team was composed entirely of strangers, three of whom were programmers and one artist. Because of this imbalance, I ended up taking more of a QA and Project Management role in the team, but it was still a fun time.
I still remember staying late with one of the other team members and building the title screen and opening sequence from scratch. I'm very proud of the transition that happens when you hit the start button. I also named the game!
