So in October, Hack The Box does an annual Halloween-themed CTF and one of my mates persuaded me to join this one shortly after I came back from an overseas trip. The CTF was split into a practice period and a real period. 

I didn't have much time for either CTF periods and they were quite short so I focused on learning a specific concept instead of accumulating points. I definitely had a lot of fun learning the methods that I got around to with my favourite one being JSON Web Token Forgery.
I've included a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yPnN2TW7SeCPQxXedLZqcow3GqyBvULvu1mK_O5ZQ7A/edit?usp=sharing) to the small write-ups for the challenges I did so if anyone is interested.

Above this post is my certificate for competing in the real period. I also got a certificate for joining in the practice round too.

P.S. I dressed up as Steve Jobs this year for Halloween.
